# Troubleshooting

If you only have 2 minutes, use this page as a triage front door.

## First 60 seconds

Run this exact ladder in order:

```bash
remoteclaw status
remoteclaw status --all
remoteclaw gateway probe
remoteclaw gateway status
remoteclaw doctor
remoteclaw channels status --probe
remoteclaw logs --follow
```

Good output in one line:

- `remoteclaw status` → shows configured channels and no obvious auth errors.
- `remoteclaw status --all` → full report is present and shareable.
- `remoteclaw gateway probe` → expected gateway target is reachable.
- `remoteclaw gateway status` → `Runtime: running` and `RPC probe: ok`.
- `remoteclaw doctor` → no blocking config/service errors.
- `remoteclaw channels status --probe` → channels report `connected` or `ready`.
- `remoteclaw logs --follow` → steady activity, no repeating fatal errors.

<summary>No replies</summary>

    ```bash
    remoteclaw status
    remoteclaw gateway status
    remoteclaw channels status --probe
    remoteclaw pairing list --channel <channel> [--account <id>]
    remoteclaw logs --follow
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `Runtime: running`
    - `RPC probe: ok`
    - Your channel shows connected/ready in `channels status --probe`
    - Sender appears approved (or DM policy is open/allowlist)

    Common log signatures:

    - `drop guild message (mention required` → mention gating blocked the message in Discord.
    - `pairing request` → sender is unapproved and waiting for DM pairing approval.
    - `blocked` / `allowlist` in channel logs → sender, room, or group is filtered.

<summary>Dashboard or Control UI will not connect</summary>

    ```bash
    remoteclaw status
    remoteclaw gateway status
    remoteclaw logs --follow
    remoteclaw doctor
    remoteclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `Dashboard: http://...` is shown in `remoteclaw gateway status`
    - `RPC probe: ok`
    - No auth loop in logs

    Common log signatures:

    - `device identity required` → HTTP/non-secure context cannot complete device auth.
    - `unauthorized` / reconnect loop → wrong token/password or auth mode mismatch.
    - `gateway connect failed:` → UI is targeting the wrong URL/port or unreachable gateway.

    ```bash
    remoteclaw status
    remoteclaw gateway status
    remoteclaw logs --follow
    remoteclaw doctor
    remoteclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `Service: ... (loaded)`
    - `Runtime: running`
    - `RPC probe: ok`

    Common log signatures:

    - `Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local` → gateway mode is unset/remote.
    - `refusing to bind gateway ... without auth` → non-loopback bind without token/password.
    - `another gateway instance is already listening` or `EADDRINUSE` → port already taken.

    ```bash
    remoteclaw status
    remoteclaw gateway status
    remoteclaw logs --follow
    remoteclaw doctor
    remoteclaw channels status --probe
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - Channel transport is connected.
    - Pairing/allowlist checks pass.
    - Mentions are detected where required.

    Common log signatures:

    - `mention required` → group mention gating blocked processing.
    - `pairing` / `pending` → DM sender is not approved yet.
    - `not_in_channel`, `missing_scope`, `Forbidden`, `401/403` → channel permission token issue.

<summary>Cron or heartbeat did not fire or did not deliver</summary>

    remoteclaw cron status
    remoteclaw cron list
    remoteclaw cron runs --id <jobId> --limit 20
    remoteclaw logs --follow
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - `cron.status` shows enabled with a next wake.
    - `cron runs` shows recent `ok` entries.
    - Heartbeat is enabled and not outside active hours.

    Common log signatures:

    - `cron: scheduler disabled; jobs will not run automatically` → cron is disabled.
    - `heartbeat skipped` with `reason=quiet-hours` → outside configured active hours.
    - `requests-in-flight` → main lane busy; heartbeat wake was deferred.
    - `unknown accountId` → heartbeat delivery target account does not exist.

    remoteclaw status
    remoteclaw gateway status
    remoteclaw nodes status
    remoteclaw nodes describe --node <idOrNameOrIp>
    remoteclaw logs --follow
    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - Node is listed as connected and paired for role `node`.
    - Capability exists for the command you are invoking.
    - Permission state is granted for the tool.

    Common log signatures:

    - `NODE_BACKGROUND_UNAVAILABLE` → bring node app to foreground.
    - `*_PERMISSION_REQUIRED` → OS permission was denied/missing.
    - `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: approval required` → exec approval is pending.
    - `SYSTEM_RUN_DENIED: allowlist miss` → command not on exec allowlist.

    ```

    Good output looks like:

    - Browser status shows `running: true` and a chosen browser/profile.
    - `remoteclaw` profile starts or `chrome` relay has an attached tab.

    Common log signatures:

    - `Failed to start Chrome CDP on port` → local browser launch failed.
